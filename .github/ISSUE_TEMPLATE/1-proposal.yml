        ## Proposals

        This form provides a tracker issue for a proposal. It is intended to allow work on the proposal to be tracked, and for the proposal to eventually be prioritised/selected.

        The actual _detail_ of the proposal should be captured as a [Discussion](https://github.com/hcsolutions/careportal/discussions/new?category=proposals) with a similar name.
